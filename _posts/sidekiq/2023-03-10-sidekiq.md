## Who wants a Sidekiq?

Sidekiq is a powerful Ruby gem that allows you to easily manage background jobs in your application. It is designed to be simple to use, efficient and reliable. With Sidekiq, you can easily perform tasks in the background, such as sending emails, running reports, processing data and execution of repetitive or scheduled tasks.

Sidekiq also provides a Web UI dashboard that allows you to monitor the status of your jobs and other metric information such as memory usage. You can view the number of jobs that are queued, running, completed or failed as well as view the job history and details, including information about exceptions or errors that appear.

## Briefly about the architecture

Sidekiq uses Redis as an in-memory data structure store and is written in Ruby. It also supports Java clients. It can be used with [Resque](https://github.com/resque/resque), another Redis based job scheduler, or more commonly as a standalone product. Sidekiq reads jobs from a Redis queue, using the FIFO model to process jobs. Job processing is asynchronous and allows a web thread to serve requests rather than process heavy tasks.
